# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Tidal-Prediction-Machine - A project for tidal prediction.

**Current Status:** New repository - project structure and implementation are not yet established.

## Project Setup

This repository is currently in its initial state. The following components need to be defined:

- Programming language and framework selection
- Project structure and directory organization
- Build system and dependency management
- Testing framework
- Development and deployment workflows

## Next Steps

When setting up this project, consider:

1. **Language/Stack Selection**: Determine the primary programming language (Python is common for scientific/prediction applications)
2. **Data Sources**: Identify and document tidal data sources (NOAA, tidal APIs, etc.)
3. **Prediction Approach**: Define the methodology (harmonic analysis, machine learning, physical models)
4. **Project Structure**: Establish directory organization for data, models, scripts, tests
5. **Dependencies**: Set up package management (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)
6. **Documentation**: Expand README.md with project goals, setup instructions, and usage

## Important Notes

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project architecture and development workflows are established. Include:
- Build and test commands once they're defined
- Architectural decisions and patterns
- Data processing pipelines
- Model training and evaluation procedures
